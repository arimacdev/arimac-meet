# Arimac Meet on Docker

We have implemented **[Arimac Meet](https://meet.arimac.digital)** on Docker using Jitsi Open Source project.

[Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) is a set of Open Source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions.

Arimac Meet is a fully encrypted, 100% Open Source video conferencing solution that you can use all day, every day, for free â€” with no account needed.

This repository contains the necessary tools to run a Arimac Meet stack on [Docker](https://www.docker.com) using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

## Architecture

In this section a global overview of the Arimac Meet (on top of Docker) infrastructure is provided. If you just started contributing to the project, we highly recommend reading this section thoroughly.

### Components
Arimac Meet comprises a collection of projects:

-   **Arimac Meet** - WebRTC compatible JavaScript application that uses Jitsi Videobridge to provide high quality, scalable video conferences. Build upon React and React Native.
-   **Jitsi Videobridge (JVB)**  - WebRTC compatible server designed to route video streams amongst participants in a conference.
-  **Jitsi Conference Focus (jicofo)**  - server-side focus component used in Jitsi Meet conferences that manages media sessions and acts as load balancer between each of the participants and the videobridge.
-   **Jitsi Gateway to SIP (jigasi)**  - server-side application that allows regular SIP clients to join Jitsi Meet conferences
-   **Jitsi Broadcasting Infrastructure (jibri)** - set of tools for recording and/or streaming a Jitsi Meet conference that works by launching a Chrome instance rendered in a virtual framebuffer and capturing and encoding the output with ffmpeg.

External Software used by Arimac Meet:

-   [Prosody](https://prosody.im/)  - XMPP server used for signalling

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Arimac Meet on your server, make sure you have following software are installed on your host machine:

-  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

-  [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

-  [Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/) (Native)

***Note:** you can skip Nginx native installation by using Nginx service on Docker as a service itself*

## Installation

Follow these basic instructions to install to customize Arimac Meet anywhere.

### Open Required Ports in Firewall

The following external ports must be opened on a firewall:

- **80/tcp** for Web UI HTTP

- **443/tcp** for Web UI HTTPS

- **4443/tcp** for RTP media over TCP

- **10000/udp** for RTP media over UDP

- Also **20000-20050/udp** for jigasi, in case you choose to deploy that to facilitate SIP access.

### Basic Setup & Configuration

You can basically do following common steps in order to bring Arimac Meet alive on your server:

**Step 1:** Clone this repo in to your server as follows:

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:mr_arimac/arimac-meet.git arimac_meet
```

**Step 2:** Copy `env.example` into `.env` :

```bash
cd arimac_meet
sudo cp env.example .env
```

Now, edit `.env` file as your preferences.

**Step 3:** Run `gen-passwords.sh` script to generate required inter communication passwords:

```bash
sudo chmod +x gen-passwords.sh
sudo ./gen-passwords.sh
```

**Step 4:** Create required `CONFIG` directories:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p ~/.jitsi-meet-cfg/{web/letsencrypt,transcripts,prosody/config,prosody/prosody-plugins-custom,jicofo,jvb,jigasi,jibri}
```

**Step 5:** Customize frontend:

You can now inject your custom files to localhost mounted location.

```bash
cd arimac_meet/arimac-meet-ui/web-customization
```
You can add your customization here and exit. Then, all is ready.

**Step 6:** Set up **Jibri** for video recording:

Before running Jibri, you need to set up an ALSA loopback device on the host. This **will not** work on a non-Linux host.

For ***CentOS 7/8***, the module is already compiled with the kernel, so just run:

```bash
# configure 5 capture/playback interfaces
echo "options snd-aloop enable=1,1,1,1,1 index=0,1,2,3,4" > /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-loopback.conf # setup autoload the module
echo "snd_aloop" > /etc/modules-load.d/snd_aloop.conf

# load the module
modprobe snd-aloop

# check that the module is loaded
lsmod | grep snd_aloop
```

For ***Ubuntu:***
```bash
# install the module
apt update && apt install linux-image-extra-virtual

# configure 5 capture/playback interfaces
echo "options snd-aloop enable=1,1,1,1,1 index=0,1,2,3,4" > /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-loopback.conf

# setup autoload the module
echo "snd-aloop" >> /etc/modules

# check that the module is loaded
lsmod | grep snd_aloop
```

***NOTE:*** If you are running on AWS you may need to reboot your machine to use the generic kernel instead of the "aws" kernel. If after reboot, your machine is still using the "aws" kernel, you'll need to manually update the grub file. So just run:

```bash
# open the grub file in editor
nano /etc/default/grub

# Modify the value of GRUB_DEFAULT from "0" to "1>2"
# Save and exit from file

grub update-grub
sudo reboot
```

**Step 7:** Set up ***Etherpad*** services:

If you like, additionally you can setup Etherpad for documentation purposes while on meeting.
In the `docker-compose.yml` file, I've already included etherpad services.
Only thing you have to do is defining etherpad domain and related stuff.


**Step 8:** Start application:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Now all is set go!

*For advanced setup you can refer official Jitsi documentation [here](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-docker).*

Your **Arimac Meet** is now live on one of your domain as bellow example:

- http://meet.arimac.digital:8000
- https://meet.arimac.digital:8443


## Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup

We can use Nginx reverse proxy to handle the traffic into our application properly.

**Step 1:** create a configuration block:
```bash
vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/meet.arimac.digital.conf
```
Change your domain name accordingly.

Then, add following content:

Make sure to change, `server_name` value with your domain name.

```bash
server {
 server_name meet.arimac.digital;
 listen 80;
  
 location / {
	 ssi on;
	 proxy_pass https://localhost:8443;
	 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
	 proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
 }
 location /xmpp-websocket {
	 proxy_pass https://localhost:8443/xmpp-websocket;
	 proxy_http_version 1.1;
	 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	 proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
 }
 location /colibri-ws/ {
	 proxy_pass https://localhost:8443/colibri-ws/;
	 proxy_http_version 1.1;
	 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	 proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
 }
 # Etherpad-lite
 location ^~ /etherpad/ {
	 proxy_pass http://localhost:9001/;
	 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
	 proxy_buffering off;
	 proxy_set_header       Host $host;
 }
}
server {
 if ($host = meet.arimac.digital) {
	 return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
 } 
 server_name meet.arimac.digital;
 listen 80;
}
```

**Step 2:** Make sure Nginx configuration is resolving successfully:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

**Step 3:** Restart Nginx and make sure it's running properly:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

## Let's Encrypt Free SSL

Arimac Meet requires SSL to ensure all communications are done properly with the highest security it has.
In this case, we can provision a free SSL Certificate from Let's Encrypt SSL Authority.

***Note:** Before going forward, please make sure Meet domain is correctly resolving to your host machine's public IP Address.*

**Step 1:** Install Certbot:

Please visit https://certbot.eff.org and select Nginx as the software and your system as preffered in order to install certbot manager on your host machine.

Now all is ready to provision a free auto-renewing SSL certificate for your Meet domain.

**Step 2:** Provision SSL Certificate

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d meet.arimac.digital -d www.meet.arimac.digital
```
***Note:*** Make sure to replace your domain name with `meet.arimac.digital` .
